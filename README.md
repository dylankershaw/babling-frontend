## Demo

Users can select from existing chats or start a new one. All chats are persisted and stored on API.

<br />

![message polling](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o75209z1ytFfQlANq/giphy.gif)

Chats are polled every second to make sending and receiving messages nearly instantaenous.

<br />

![language change](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HTZKcvw96BQJp5K/giphy.gif)

Chat language can be changed on the fly. Every message gets automatically translated into that language if it has not previously been selected. Once it has been translated, its translation remains on the database for fast subsequent language switching. [See here for code](https://github.com/dylankershaw/babling-backend/blob/master/app/controllers/api/v1/chats_controller.rb) (see the Update action).
